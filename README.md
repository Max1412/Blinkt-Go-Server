# Blinkt-Go-Server

A webserver written in Go, supposed to run on a Raspberry Pi to remotely control [Blinkt!](https://shop.pimoroni.de/products/blinkt) LEDs.
It uses the following libraries:
* https://github.com/alexellis/blinkt_go
* https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/go-colorful

This is my first project written in Go.

I'm trying to use the Go project layout: https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout
